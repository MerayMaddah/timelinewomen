This R code uses the IPU's Parline dataset regarding first women MPs entering parliament (i.e., years). I added the exact months and dates of each year (per country).
The code uses the "timelineS" package developed by https://github.com/cran/timelineS to visualise the timeline of which women MPs entered parliament for the first time in continental Europe.
